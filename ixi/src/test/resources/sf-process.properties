# Each stringflow server instance makes use of Session Manager to 
# store user sessions. UserSession keeps all the Local Session 
# instances which internal keeps stream related information along with
# TCP socket which user is connected to. The type of the store 
# indicates if the server process will make use of an internal
# session store (within the JVM memory space) or an external session
# store. When stringflow is running in cluster mode, session store
# type MUST be external. sf.session-manager.store property indicates
# the Session Store implementation which will be used by Session
# Manager to store user sessions.

# Barring few exceptions, a Message packet is rarely processed within
# server process; a Message packet from a user is simply delivered to
# another user (destination). By default each packet is handed-over 
# to Packet Router for routing. However if there is a single instance
# of Stringflow server running and messages packets are subjected to
# no other processing, IOController can be shot circuited to route
# Message packets to destination TCP sockets. This results in 
# performance improvements.
